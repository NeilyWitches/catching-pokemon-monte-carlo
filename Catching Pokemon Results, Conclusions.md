# Catching Pokémon: Monte Carlo Simulation
In this Monte Carlo simulation, I used the algorithm from the first generation of pokemon games to write up the code in Python 3. The program contains several functions, but the first function is the simulation itself which simulates throwing a Poké Ball at a Pokémon. It returns the value of the boolean variable, caught = True if the Pokémon was "caught" or False if the Pokémon was "set free." The probability of a catch depends on several in-game variables including the Pokémon's health, status, what kind of Poké Ball was thrown, and the Pokémon itself. I had the program throw Poké Balls at a Pokémon until it was caught and count the number of Poké Balls it used. It was programmed to do this 500 times to obtain a mean number of Poké Balls thrown. Then, the program took 100 samples to obtain 100 mean values, which I plotted. I threw standard Poké Balls at a Pokémon that was notoriously difficult to catch in the first generation of games, to wit, Mewtwo with full hp, and no status ailments. I threw the balls until it was caught 500 times and the number of Poké Balls used for each time has a distribution of that seen in Figure 1. The program then took the mean number of this distribution and plotted it along with 99 other samples producing the normal distribution seen in Figure 2. I call this group of samples the control group because I then started altering the variables one at a time. Figure 3 shows the distribution of samples once Ultra Balls were used in place of Poké Balls. You can see that there is hardly a noticable difference in these distributions. In fact, the mean was shifted from the control's 109 Poké Balls to the 113 Ultra Balls. The increase in mean values is most likely due to random error since using Ultra Balls theoretically increase the probability of a catch. I then froze the Mewtwo producing the distribution in Figure 4. These results are the most interesting as they expose which variable produces the most drastic change in mean number of Poké Balls used when keeping all other variables constant. Next, the Mewtwo's HP was changed from 100% to 1% producing the distribution seen in Figure 5, and shifting the mean from 109 to 64. After, Ultra Balls were used alongside freezing Mewtwo, keeping its HP at 100%. This produces the distribution in Figure 6 with a mean of 6 Ultra Balls used. The Ultra Ball apparently exposes its utility once used in conjunction with a status ailment. Keeping the Ultra Ball, removing any status ailment on the Mewtwo, but reducing its health back down to 1% produced the distribution seen in Figure 7 which has a mean of 38 Ultra Balls. This distribution further exposes the necessity of freezing or putting the Pokémon to sleep for easy capture. Switching to Poké Balls, freezing Mewtwo, and keeping its HP at 1%, we find the distribution seen in Figure 8, which has a mean number of 9 Poké Balls. Finally, putting everything together, i.e. switching back to Ultra Balls, keeping it frozen, and its HP at 1% produces the distribution found in Figure 9 which has a mean of 5 Ultra Balls used before Mewtwo was caught. In conclusion, the results show that freezing or putting the Pokémon to sleep is the most effective method of catching a Pokémon. If Ultra Balls are a disposable commodity, then I advise their usage, otherwise they are not as important as lowering HP and especially not as important as freeze or sleep. Mind you, the HP must be lowered to 1%, which is typically done with false swipe, a move that is rare or by carefully attacking which runs the risk of causing the Pokémon to faint, meanwhile simply using a move that puts the Pokémon to sleep can be done in one move (of which there are a plethora) and further prevents the opposing Pokémon from attacking. Ranking the methods in order from least effective to most effective: Only throw Poké Balls, only throw Ultra Balls, lower the HP then throw Poké Balls, lower the HP then throw Ultra Balls, simply freeze or sleep then throw Poké Balls, lower the HP and freeze or sleep then throw Poké Balls, freeze or sleeping then throw Ultra Balls (my personal favorite), lastly, surprising nobody, doing all three methods together.

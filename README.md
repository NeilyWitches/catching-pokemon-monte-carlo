# catching-pokemon-monte-carlo
In this Monte Carlo simulation, I used the algorithm from the first generation of pokemon games to write up the code in Python 3. The program contains several functions, but the first function is the simulation itself which simulates throwing a Poké Ball at a Pokémon. It returns the value of the boolean variable, caught = True if the Pokémon was "caught" or False if the Pokémon was "set free." The probability of a catch depends on several in-game variables including the Pokémon's health, status, what kind of Poké Ball was thrown, and the Pokémon itself. I performed hundreds of simulations of 1 kind: a very hard to catch pokemon
